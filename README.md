# Amalgam by rei-kes for Team Fortress 2
With a few more features here and there, notable changes include;
- A killstreak changer that doesn't work
- Backtrack to crosshair
- Player cosmetics removal
- Fast stop that utilizes counter strafing
- Capture flag esp/chams/glow and return timer
- Teleporter recharge timer
- Healthpack/Ammopack respawn timer that works
- Hurt teammates chams when playing as medic
- PS2/Low graphic models and flat textures toggle
- Ping reducer with a target ping
- Live font changer
- Force enabled game fixes and pure bypass because why would you ever not want those
- And possibly more

This is uploaded as an archive of my changes (and because the original repo went byebye).
